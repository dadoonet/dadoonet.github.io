I'm often running some demos during conferences where we have a booth.
As many others, I'm using Twitter feed as my datasource.

I have been using [Twitter river plugin](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-river-twitter) for many years but, you know, [rivers have been deprecated](https://www.elastic.co/blog/deprecating_rivers).

Logstash [1.5.0](https://www.elastic.co/blog/logstash-1-5-0-ga-released) provides a safer and more flexible way to deal with tweets with its [twitter input](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-twitter.html).

Let's do it!

<!--more-->

Let's assume that you have already elasticsearch 1.5.2, Logstash 1.5.0 and Kibana 4.0.2 running on your laptop or on a cloud instance.

## Twitter application

Create first your [Twitter application](https://apps.twitter.com/) and open the "Keys and Access Tokens" tab.
Note your `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` (generate them if needed).
Note also your `access_token` and `access_token_secret` (generate them if needed).

## Logstash configuration

First define your twitter input to track whatever term you want. Let's say here that I will collect data for [dotScale conference](http://www.dotscale.io/) (Elastic sponsors it so if you are around come to say hello at our booth!):

```ruby
input {
  twitter {
      consumer_key => "consumer_key"
      consumer_secret => "consumer_secret"
      oauth_token => "access_token"
      oauth_token_secret => "access_token_secret"
      keywords => [ "dotscale" ]
      full_tweet => true
  }
}
```

We won't do any filtering as tweets come as JSON documents already well formed.
We could of course omit some fields but let's keep that simple:

```ruby
filter {
}
```

Connect elasticsearch:

```ruby
output {
  stdout { codec => dots }
  elasticsearch {
    protocol => "http"
    host => "localhost"
    index => "twitter"
    document_type => "tweet"
    template => "twitter_template.json"
    template_name => "twitter"
  }
}
```

## Elasticsearch template

We have set that we will use a `twitter` template defined in `twitter_template.json`:

```json
{
  "template": "twitter",
  "order":    1, 
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1 
  },
  "mappings": {
    "tweet": { 
      "_all": {
        "enabled": false
      },
      "dynamic_templates" : [ {
         "message_field" : {
           "match" : "message",
           "match_mapping_type" : "string",
           "mapping" : {
             "type" : "string", "index" : "analyzed", "omit_norms" : true
           }
         }
       }, {
         "string_fields" : {
           "match" : "*",
           "match_mapping_type" : "string",
           "mapping" : {
             "type" : "string", "index" : "analyzed", "omit_norms" : true,
               "fields" : {
                 "raw" : {"type": "string", "index" : "not_analyzed", "ignore_above" : 256}
               }
           }
         }
       } ],
      "properties": {
        "text": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "coordinates": {
          "properties": {
             "coordinates": {
                "type": "geo_point"
             },
             "type": {
                "type": "string"
             }
          }
       }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We are basically using something similar to logstash default template but we also disable `raw` subfield for `message` field and we define that `coordinates.coordinates` is actually a [geo_point](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-geo-point-type.html).

Then, we can start logstash with this configuration and let it run forever...

```sh
nohup bin/logstash -f dotscale.conf &
```

If you send some tweets, you should be able to see them indexed in elasticsearch:

{{< tweet user="dadoonetest" id="605370839328915456" >}}

```json
GET twitter/_search
```

This should give you some tweets back.

## Kibana

And now you can play with Kibana!

## Open your data (but secure them first)

If you want to share your results, you should secure your elasticsearch instance before opening it to the world!

I tried at first to add a Ngnix layer but I had hard time configuring it.
I decided then to use [Shield](https://www.elastic.co/products/shield) which is a free add-on for elasticsearch customers (yeah we have a [fantastic support team](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) who can definitely help you to build the best cluster ever).

Shield has a 30 days evaluation period so here I can use it as I will most likely track data only from few days before the conference and to some days after.

```sh
bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/license/latest
bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/shield/latest
```

Restart elasticsearch.

Then you can a new user who has the default `logstash` role:

```sh
bin/shield/esusers useradd twitter -r logstash
```

Give whatever password you want...

Modify Logstash configuration as now your elasticsearch output needs to provide credentials:

```ruby
output {
  elasticsearch {
    protocol => "http"
    host => "localhost"
    index => "twitter"
    document_type => "tweet"
    template => "twitter_template.json"
    template_name => "twitter"
    user => "twitter"
    password => "whateverpasswordyouset"
  }
}
```

Restart Logstash and you're done!

You probably want to also create another user who can access to Kibana4:

```sh
bin/shield/esusers useradd dadoonet -r kibana4
```

Set your password. And now you should be able to connect to Kibana4 using your username and password.

## Update (after dotScale event)

I finally got this result after one day at dotScale.
