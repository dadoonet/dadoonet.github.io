Search is not just traditional TF/IDF any more but the current trend of machine learning and models has opened another dimension for search.

This talk gives an overview of:

* “Classic” search and its limitations
* What is a model and how can you use it
* How to use vector search in Elasticsearch

The main demo covers how to generate embeddings from a music and then use the techniques we learned to propose the most probable version of it when we hum a song 🎶🎸🎻.
