Search is not just traditional TF/IDF any more but the current trend of machine learning and models has opened another dimension for search.
This talk gives an overview of:

“Classic” search and its limitations
What is a model and how can you use it
How to use vector search or hybrid search in Elasticsearch
Where OpenAI’s ChatGPT or similar LLMs come into play to with Elastic

This talk covers the state of the art in terms of search nowadays: BM25, Vector search, Embeddings, Hybrid Search, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, and OpenAI integration. The main demo covers how to generate embeddings from a piece of music and then use the techniques we learned to propose the most probable version of it when we hum a song.
