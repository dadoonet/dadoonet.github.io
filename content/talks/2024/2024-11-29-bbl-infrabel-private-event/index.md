Elasticsearch and Kibana added a brand new query language: ES|QL — coming with a new endpoint (`_query`) and a simplified syntax. It lets you refine your results one step at a time and adds new features like data enrichment and processing right in your query. And you can use it across the Elastic Stack — from the Elasticsearch API to Discover and Alerting in Kibana. But the biggest change is behind the scenes: Using a new compute engine that was built with performance in mind.

Join us for an overview and a look at syntax and internals.
