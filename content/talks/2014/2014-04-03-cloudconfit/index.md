Elasticsearch is a search server based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with a RESTful web interface and schema-free JSON documents. You can use it as well to compute information on live data.
Kibana is a full web application built with AngularJS. It's a generic and powerful visualisation tool for your data.

Both projects are under Apache 2 Licence.

During this session, you will discover how elasticsearch actually works. We will inject marketing data into elasticsearch and build live a dashboard using Kibana. In minutes, you will know how to build **YOUR** own dashboard and make sense of **YOUR** data.
