Elasticsearch: you know, for search! But you can use it as well to compute information on live data.

During this session, you will discover how elasticsearch actually works behind the scene and why this great open source software is really more than "search". We will inject marketing data into elasticsearch and build live a dashboard using Kibana, generic and powerful visualisation tool under Apache2 license. In minutes, you will know how to build **YOUR** own dashboard and make sense of **YOUR** data!
