During this "live coding" talk, Tugdual and David will move an old-fashion full SQL application to the NoSQL world.
Using CouchBase and Elasticsearch, they will show all gains you can have with this new architecture:

- Easyness
- Elasticity (scalablity)

Following points will be covered:

- Document Oriented Model
- JSon
- REST
- Caching / Memcache
- Full text search
- Building live dashboards with Kibana
