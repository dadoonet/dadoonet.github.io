How to mix SQL and NoSQL worlds without a revolution?

This live coding talk will show you how to add elasticsearch in your legacy application without changing all your habits. Your application will be able to have advanced search features without the need of writing complex SQL code!

David will start from a RestX, Hibernate, Postgresql application and will add live during this session a complete integration of elasticsearch:

* Why should we add NoSQL search?
* bad practices (JDBC river, external batch...)
* how to represent business entities in NoSQL documents?
* elasticsearch beyonder project
* How to live without transactions inside a transactional application?
