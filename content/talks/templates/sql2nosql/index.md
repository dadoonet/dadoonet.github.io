    abstract: |
      During this "live coding" talk, Tugdual and David will move an old-fashion full SQL application to the NoSQL world.
      Using CouchBase and Elasticsearch, they will show all gains you can have with this new architecture:
      
      - Easyness
      - Elasticity (scalablity)
      
      Following points will be covered:
      
      - Document Oriented Model
      - JSon
      - REST
      - Caching / Memcache
      - Full text search
      - Building live dashboards with Kibana
