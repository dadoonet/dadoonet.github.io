Developer | Evangelist at [elastic](https://elastic.co) and creator of the [Elastic French User Group](https://www.meetup.com/elasticfr/). Frequent speaker about all things Elastic, in conferences, for User Groups and in companies with [BBL talks](https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2024-08-01-free-lunches-for-opensource-engineers). In my free time, I enjoy coding and deejaying as [DJ Elky](https://www.instagram.com/dj_elky/reels/), just for fun. Living with my children in Cergy, France.
